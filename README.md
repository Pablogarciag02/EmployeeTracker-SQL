## About this Project
-Every company must use a database or a table to manage and know information about their employees
Allthough excel is a usefull choice, SQL takes it up a notch

-Due to this, i developed an employee tracker that allows any company to create, add remove and assign roles to any employee thanks to their department and salary

-This makes it easy for any company to manage their workers and for them to be able to update, their current workforce, change roles for the workers, remove and delete certain employees, etc...

This project uses
[SQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) Connects to sql database
[Console.Table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) Adds a console.table method for convinience.
